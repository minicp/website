Conflict-based Search Strategies
=================================================================

Implement the Last Conflict [LC2009]_ and Conflict Ordering Search [COS2015]_ heuristics.

In MiniCP, a conflict is when when an inconsistency occurs during search. 
The last conflicting variable is the most recent variable that was branched on. 
In MiniCP, when an inconsistency occurs, an `InconsistencyException` is thrown and needs to be caught during branching by the conflict search heuristic.

Test your implementations in `LastConflictSearchTest.java <https://github.com/minicp/minicp/blob/master/src/test/java/minicp/search/LastConflictSearchTest.java>`_
and `ConflictOrderingSearchTest.java. <https://github.com/minicp/minicp/blob/master/src/test/java/minicp/search/ConflictOrderingSearchTest.java>`_.

Bound-Impact Value Selector
=================================================================

Implement the bound-impact value selector [BIVS2017]_ in order to discover good solutions quickly.

Implement within `TSPBoundImpact.java <https://github.com/minicp/minicp/blob/master/src/main/java/minicp/examples/TSPBoundImpact.java>`_.
Verify experimentally that the first solution found is smaller than with the default minimum-value heuristic.
You can also use it in combination with your conflict ordering search.

**Hint**: You can test the effect on the objective value by:

1. saving the state, 
2. fixing the selected variable to a value with the `equal` constraint, 
3. retrieving the new domain of the objective variable, and finally
4. restoring the previous state.

Don't forget to catch any `InconsistencyException` that might occur.

Limited Discrepancy Search (optional)
=================================================================

Implement `LimitedDiscrepancyBranching`, a branching that can wrap any branching to limit the discrepancy of the branching.

The following figure depicts a search tree where the number of each node is the discrepancy of that node:

Verify that your implementation passes the tests of `LimitedDiscrepancyBranchingTest.java. <https://github.com/minicp/minicp/blob/master/src/test/java/minicp/search/LimitedDiscrepancyBranchingTest.java>`_.
